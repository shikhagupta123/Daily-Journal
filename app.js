It likely felt good to get all of those thoughts and feelings out of your head and down on paper. The world seemed clearer. You may have stopped using a diary once you reached adulthood. But the concept and its benefits still apply. Now itâ€™s called journaling. It's simply writing down your thoughts and feelings to understand them more clearly. And if you struggle with stress, depression, or anxiety, keeping a journal can be a great idea. It can help you gain control of your emotions and improve your mental health."
